  datetime: Saturday, 3rd October 2020, 1:00pm - 4:00pm
  location: Zoom link to be sent to participants via email
  audience:
    Basic knowledge of Python and Jupyter is required. Some background in calculus
    (derivatives and differential equations) and probability (densities, likelihoods, expectations) will be helpful.
  description:
    In this workshop, we will learn about the keys ideas of MCMC, bits of mathematical theory, and its applications
    and implementations, including variants such as Random Walk Metropolis and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo.

    Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods were invented around the time of World War II by several mathematicians and
    physicists who worked on the Manhattan Project. What started out as a way to solve high-dimensional integrals from chemical
    physics is now a general, powerful approach to generate samples from probability distributions. It is widely applied in statistics,
    computations for the natural sciences, and more recently machine learning and data science. Regarded as one of the top 10 most
    important algorithms in the 20th century, MCMC is undoubtedly an essential tool in any scientistâ€™s technical repertoire.
