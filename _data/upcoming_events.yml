  description: As "hackers", we spend a lot of time on our computers, 
    so it makes sense to make that experience as fluid and frictionless 
    as possible. In this workshop, we'll help you learn how to make the 
    most of tools that productive programmers use, specifically how to 
    navigate the Unix command line. Please come prepared with your 
    preferred Unix-like environment installed. If you don't 
    currently have one installed, we recommend you install Ubuntu 
    using VirtualBox. (This workshop is inspired by <a href='https://hacker-tools.github.io/' target="_blank">hacker-tools class by SIPB at MIT</a>)<br>
