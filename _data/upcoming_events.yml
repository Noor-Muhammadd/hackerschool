  description: This is a crash course to programming in Python, meant for
    beginners. Python is a general-purpose programming language which is
    commonly used for things like simple automation scripting and scientific
    computing. Python has a beginner-friendly and approachable syntax, yet is
    still very powerful & extensible with third-party libraries, with its
    included package-management system. We will learn some basic programming,
    the basic syntax of python, and use some cool third-party libraries to
    showcase the extensibility and ease of scripting of Python with some
    real-life use cases.
