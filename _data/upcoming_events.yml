- title: "Introduction to Rust"
  datetime: Saturday, 9th November 2019, 1:00pm - 4:00pm
  location: SR1, COM1, School of Computing, National University of Singapore
  audience: Any faculty or the public. This is not an introduction to programming, and programming experience 
    in any language assumed. Experience with a non-garbage collected language like C or C++ will be very helpful.
  description: Rust is a systems programming language focused on zero-cost abstractions and safety, providing many 
    of the features of modern, expressive languages, like pattern matching and destructuring, iterators, and algebraic 
    data types, with as little overhead as possible compared to a handwritten version (like in C). Rust also provides 
    compile-time checking of value ownership and thread-safety. Rust also brings with it a package manager, Cargo, 
    providing the convenience loved by developers in other ecosystems, like .NET and Python.
