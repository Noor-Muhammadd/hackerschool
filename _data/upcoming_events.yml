    Git is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in source code during software development.
    It is designed for coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track changes in any set of files.
    Come learn to use Git so you can version your own personal projects, work with others, or contribute to the
    vast body of open-source projects that collaborate with Git.
