  <h2>About Us</h2>
  <p>We begin with three core premises:
    <ul>
      <li>Learning is hard</li>
      <li>Learning <b>alone</b> is <i>really</i> hard</li>
      <li>Some skills are expected of every programmer, but are not taught in school</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>hackerschool</b> teaches basic, supplementary skills that you're expected to know outside school. The goal? To make learning these skills easier, by getting people <i>past the initial hurdle</i>, through workshops and classes.
  </p>

  <h3>Our Goal</h3>
  <p>
    <a href='http://nushackers.org'>NUS Hackers</a> has conducted workshops in the past. <b>What makes this different is its scale.</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    Though we are starting small, with only a few courses, we have a <b>big</b> ambition. The hope is to ultimately have a comprehensive list of workshops that incoming freshman and <i>all NUS students</i> can look forward to and take part in. 
  </p>
  <p>
    These courses will be continuously reviewed and conducted on a regular <i>(yearly)</i> basis.  </p>

  <h3>Our Workshops</h3>
  <p>
    <b>We charge a nominal fee for our workshops.</b> This, in our experience, translates into a significant difference in terms of the crowd we attract as well as the general atmosphere during the workshops.
  </p>
